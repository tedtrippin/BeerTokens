THE PLOUGH is the fifth most common pub name in Britain and the most popular not to involve heraldry. Particularly popular in agricultural areas, the name probably marks a pub close to where the community plough was kept. Some artists used the constellation of Ursa Major, commonly known as the plough, as an illustration on the sign insteadâ€”some of these pubs found their name evolving into the Seven Stars.
